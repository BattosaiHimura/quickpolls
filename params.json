  "body": "## Idea\r\nYou're at the most interesting lecture in the world when suddenly the Professor asks \"have you all understood?\" but no, you have not; yet you're too ashamed to rise your hand and ask for some clarifications. It happens to all of us, all the time, that's the reason why this project came to our minds!\r\n\r\nBy using **Quick Polls**, the Professor can swiftly upload a poll with the topics treated on a lesson before or right after it takes place, then ask for his students to easily and anonymously submit their opinion about how much they understood each topic in order to have aggregated data about the poll and information about what to recall the lesson after.\r\n\r\nStarting from this idea, many other useful features can be added, having always in mind the principles of usage simplicity and user experience.\r\n\r\n## But Why?\r\nThis idea comes to the world as a project developed by Team9 (ASW @ Unibo, 2016) for the 'Web Applications and Services' class but we all think it could go far beyond the exam scope and maybe become a useful tool to improve courses everywhere. Wish us good luck!\r\n",
